          At Celestora Jewellery Technology making jewellery is not an industrial process, but rather an art form. The group strongly believes that exquisite jewellery is defined by the quality of its artisans and the creative experience of its craftsmen. Here artistry leads the way, and technology is used to enhance fine jewellery making rather than replace it. It is this small difference in mindset that sets Celestora apart from its peers.
